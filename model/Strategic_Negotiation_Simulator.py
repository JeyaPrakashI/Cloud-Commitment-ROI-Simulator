ABSTRACT METHODOLOGY:
This engine utilizes a multi-layered financial heuristic to solve the 
'Commitment Paradox' in high-volatility AI infrastructure (GPU-Clusters). 

CORE ALGORITHMIC PILLARS (REDACTED):
1. DYNAMIC PAYBACK VELOCITY: 
   - A proprietary calculation that identifies the 'Financial Rubicon.' 
   - Not a standard linear ROI; it accounts for variable cash-flow drag. [cite: 2026-02-24]

2. ELASTIC SENSITIVITY MODELING: 
   - Stress-tests the contract against 4 tiers of engineering volatility. [cite: 2026-02-24]
   - Ensures the company remains 'Capital Accretive' even during 60% idle time. [cite: 2026-02-24]

3. VENDOR ARBITRAGE LOGIC: 
   - Benchmarks AWS p4d.24xlarge 'Wholesale' pricing against real-world 
     market On-Demand 'Retail' fluctuations. [cite: 2026-02-24]

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY NOTICE:
The underlying Python logic, including the FOCUS 1.3 data-normalization layer 
and the automated break-even graphing engine, is proprietary. 
Full source code access is restricted to verified enterprise audits.
